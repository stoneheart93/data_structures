21. [You are given a set of n types of rectangular 3-D boxes, where the ith box has height h(i), width w(i) and depth d(i). You want to create a stack of boxes which is as tall as possible, but you can only stack a box on top of another box if the dimensions of the 2-D base of the lower box are each strictly larger than those of the 2-D base of the higher box. Of course, you can rotate a box so that any side functions as its base. It is also allowable to use multiple instances of the same type of box](box_stacking.cpp)
